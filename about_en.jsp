	PixPack is a service of Laukien dot COM and was born by an Enlightware-project.
</p>
<p>
	The idea behind PixPack is to offer a free "image Hosting service" which offers all current possibilities.
	Differently PixPack does not base on script languages, which are neither performant nor future-oriented.
	Thus PixPack bases on "real" applications on servers, which also satisfy the needs of the customers on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>
	Although PixPack plans also see the possibility to earn money with its service, it is primarily intended for the covering of the costs, that the supply of the server technology, the traffic and the support of the project
	<br/>
	The "Premium account" is to be seen as financial support.
	The additional function includes functions, which means higher requirements to the servers.
