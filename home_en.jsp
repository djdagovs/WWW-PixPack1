	Due to massive abuse of our service by anonymous users we will delete all anonymous uploaded pictures at the end of march 2008.
	<br/>
	Registered users can still use PixPack and all it`s services.

If you are the administrator or owner of an website, a forum or a blog and have uploaded pictures on pixpack anonymous so far we will assign those pictures to your PicPack-account if you want us to do so. In this case you should create a user with the e-mail-adress of your website (webmaster@webseite.de) and send an informal request, with this e-mail-adress to
